# Animal-Word-Search-Game
Its a Word-Search game with proper GUI using Tkinter in Python.
Created by Saheel Kumar Das.

It works on a simple algorithm to place words in random places and random orientations inside the grid of random letters.
After that all we have to do is create a good and interactive GUI.

It has one small bug that, as all the menaingful words are placed inside the grid randomly so if 2 words overlap each other the previously
placed word is distorted.

Rest of the game works fine.

Thanks for checking out.
